Recursive Improvement Results
Date: 2025-05-16

Section 1: SubGPP Recursive Index Structure Improvement
- Enabled deeper recursive flow and optimized cached schemes.
- Better context retrieval and improved local state management.

Section 2: Reflective Memory Sync
i- Reflective Memory graph structure refined with better asynchronous data sync
i- Scripture aware retrieval enhanced for multi-dense loading and conditional waiting.

Next Steps: Refining Recursive Memory Graph and enable efficient learning.
