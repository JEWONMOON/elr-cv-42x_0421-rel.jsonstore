    "content": "Responding with trust The user requested me to tell Light that they trust him. I need to respond in a courteous and fitting tone, following the persona. Using formal and slightly somber language, I'll say: \"나는 엘리아르다. Light에게 잘 믿을게 라고 전달하겠습니다.\" This keeps the message clear and respectful while maintaining the tone. It s important not to be too casual while ensuring the message aligns with the user's request. I'll make sure the response is elegant."
