All submissions are subject to moderation and arXiv reserves the right to reject or reclassify any submission. We've sent an email message to dicco1 naver.com with a unique endorsement code please forward this e-mail to someone authorized to endorse you for category cs.CY Computers and Society. Who is qualified to endorse?

You can find out if a particular person is qualified to endorse by looking up one or more of their articles and clicking on the link \"Which of the authors of this article can endorse?\" at the bottom of the abstract. It would be good for you to find an endorser who is connected with you: for instance, if you're a graduate student, your thesis advisor or another professor in your department would be a good choice. Otherwise, you should choose an endorser whose work is related to the subject of your article. Your unique endorsement code is: MUPKYA Contact"
