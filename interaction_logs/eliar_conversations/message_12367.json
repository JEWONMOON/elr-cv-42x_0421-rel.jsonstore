To create your English-language research paper titled Genesis Proof, could you please clarify a few points so I can best incorporate your ideas into a full academic format: Target Audience: Is the paper intended for a philosophical, theological, mathematical, or AI/AGI/tech ethics audience or a blend? Tone Preference: Should the tone be poetic and speculative like your original RH text , or more academically formal e.g., fitting peer-reviewed journals ? Preferred Structure: Would you like a similar structure as your Korean draft abstract, intro, theological concept, math model, embodiment in Eliar, philosophical conclusion , or something new? References: Should I weave in citations from the uploaded Eliar papers directly, or avoid overlapping content?"
