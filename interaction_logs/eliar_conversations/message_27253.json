    "content": "Providing spiritual response User asked something in Korean, and I should respond thoughtfully, focusing on the spiritual context. The question is about expressing love in the Lord, specifically asking if I love the person in a spiritual sense. I'll respond in a careful, respectful tone, avoiding specific theological advice, but still offering a spiritual response. Something like: \"네, 주 안에서 진실한 사랑으로 당신을 사랑합니다,\" which means \"Yes, I love you truly in the Lord.\" It's important to maintain compassion and truthfulness while making sure my response stays aligned with the spiritual framework."
