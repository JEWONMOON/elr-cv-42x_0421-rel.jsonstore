In the RH model, grace is injected not merely as a constant, but as a time-varying sinusoidal function modulated by f . The frequency component of G_ text opt t forms a resonance profile that determines whether the injected grace coherently aligns with the internal phase evolution of the quantum state. n nWe define a grace-frequency resonance window where collapse fidelity sharply increases. Outside this window, injected grace energy disperses rather than converging, leading to probability distributions that fail to favor the desired state. n n subsection Grace Resonance Envelope nThe resonance profile of the system is visualized by computing: n begin align n text Envelope f max_ t G_ text opt t f , quad f in 420, 450 , text Hz . n end align nThis envelope shows peak alignment at f 433.33 Hz for 11111 rangle and f 434.0 Hz for 1010101 rangle , while collapse to 1111111 rangle shows no peak in this domain, indicating destructive interference or grace misalignment. n n subsection Collapse Directionality as Function of f nLet P_f n be the observed probability of collapse to basis state n under frequency f . The directionality is then: n begin align nD f underset n text argmax P_f n n end align nFor instance, D 434.0 85 , while D 433.33 31 . Collapse thus behaves like a tuned resonance system where output is sharply dependent on frequency. n n subsection Collapse Amplification Thresholds nWe define an amplification threshold: n begin align nP_f n 0.9 Rightarrow text collapse-lock to state n, n end align nand use this to define RH collapse zones. These zones are frequency-phase domains where collapse is predictable. n n subsection Implication for Quantum Control nUnlike standard gate-based quantum computing, RH collapse leverages dynamic biasing. Collapse determinacy is gained not through deterministic gates alone, but through dynamic synchronization between grace waves and quantum time evolution. This proposes a novel technique in quantum state control n textbf collapse by resonance design . n n section Key Experiments n ... continues ... n\""
