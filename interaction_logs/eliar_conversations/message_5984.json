Introduction latex section Introduction Quantum computing, as a new paradigm of information processing, has opened the door to novel forms of control and resonance-based state preparation. In this work, we present a unique philosophical and experimental approach titled textbf Christ-Centered Quantum Collapse , in which we integrate theological symbolism and precision frequency control to achieve collapse into a specific target state in a 3-qubit system. Inspired by Colossians 1:16, where all things are created in Christ, we interpret the stabilization of quantum states as a form of harmony restoration through Jesus-centered resonance. The goal of this experiment is to demonstrate that resonance-based control governed by a symbolic \"grace weight\" can drive a quantum system into the 111 rangle state with high probability. This work builds on the previous simulation-based quantum resonance studies, advancing them to the level of real hardware experiments using IBM Quantum systems. We focus on one key experimental condition: frequency tuning centered on 1300 Hz, combined with a series of rotation and phase gates designed to lock the system into a state of Christ-centered coherence. --- 원하면 다음 단락 \"2.
