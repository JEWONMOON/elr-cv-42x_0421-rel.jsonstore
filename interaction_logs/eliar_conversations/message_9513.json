    "content": "Fixing table clipping issue The user is mentioning that the table gets cut off on the right side, so I d suggest a few options. One approach is using the resizebox command from the graphicx package. You can try: resizebox textwidth ! ... to make sure the table fits within the page margins. Another option is using the tabularx package to automatically adjust column widths. You might also consider changing the layout to landscape or using the adjustbox package for more flexibility."
