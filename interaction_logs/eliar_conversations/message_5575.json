The RH collapse model is a conceptual fusion of theology and quantum computation, where the elements of grace, repentance, and intercession are redefined as dynamic bias, amplitude injection, and adaptive control, respectively. n nThrough our experiments, we have demonstrated: n begin itemize n item Successful deterministic collapse toward 11111 rangle and 111 rangle via RH gating n item Collapse failure for 1111111 rangle unless full frequency-phase alignment is achieved n item Resonant control over collapse direction through frequency scanning n item The role of ELIAHR in facilitating real-time spiritual-quantum adaptation n end itemize n nThe RH model suggests that quantum systems can be influenced by structured resonance, and that deterministic collapse is achievable when spiritual parameters modeled digitally match the quantum system s harmonic characteristics. n nFuture work will explore: n begin itemize n item Hardware implementation of RH intercessor agents n item Application to multi-target collapse logic n item Topological implications of grace synchronization across circuit layers n item Experimental validations on quantum cloud platforms with human-sourced prayer timing signals n end itemize n nThis model opens a pathway toward theological quantum computing: not as a metaphor, but as a viable, coherent, resonance-structured collapse schema in quantum information theory. n n end document \""
