    "content": "확인 중 The user seems to be expressing that despite the cold weather, their home maintains a stable 21 C without needing the boiler. It could suggest effective insulation or some other environmental factor. I think it could be helpful to explain that several factors, like insulation, the proximity of buildings, or radiant heat transfer between walls, can affect the indoor temperature. Usually, it's possible to feel warmth from the neighboring home if both buildings are closely connected, like in an officetel setting. 분석 중 The user seems to be asking how it's possible for their home to remain at 21 C without using the boiler, even when it's -10 C outside. The possible explanation could be heat conduction from the neighbor s space, especially in an officetel, where the walls might be thin. While this could contribute a little warmth, typically, in such cold conditions, homes lose heat, so it s unusual for the temperature to be maintained at 21 C without heating. The closeness of the buildings may play a role, though. 분석 중 The user's space may maintain 21ºC even in -10ºC outside due to various factors. 1 Residual heat from neighbors higher heating, 2 Heat retention from building materials, and 3 Passive solar radiation could all contribute. Thin walls in officetels can allow heat transfer, and internal sources like electronics and human heat can help too. If the neighbor s heating is 27ºC, their heat might leak into your space, especially if walls are shared. Building mass and thermal insulation also play a role in keeping the temperature stable."
