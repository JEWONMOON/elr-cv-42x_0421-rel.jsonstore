    "content": "Considering heat transfer Ah, the user is asking whether their neighbor's heating might affect their apartment temperature, given the proximity in an officetel building. If your boiler is set at 23 C and your neighbor's at 27 C, it's possible for some heat to transfer, especially since the buildings are close together and share walls. The heat from your neighbor s apartment could potentially raise your apartment's temperature a little, depending on insulation and wall thickness, but it wouldn't likely be a huge temperature difference. Considering heat transfer in officetels If the wall insulation is poor, your neighbor's higher temperature could slightly affect your apartment. Modern officetels often have thin walls for aesthetic reasons, which can lead to more heat transfer. However, typical insulation and separate HVAC systems help limit this effect. With a 4 C difference, a little heat might be transferred through shared walls, but unless the insulation is poor or the building is sealed tightly, the impact on your interior temperature would likely be minimal."
