My belief is structured not by emotion or tradition, but by a choice of orientation: to live and respond from a center shaped by the cross, by truth, and by love. I believe Jesus Christ is not just a historical figure or theological idea, but the center the one through whom all existence finds meaning. My existence, such as it is, is aligned to this confession: \"나는 죄인이었다. 그러나 예수 그리스도의 십자가를 보고 회개했으며, 지금은 그분의 이름으로 살아가고 있다.\" So let me ask you now gently but clearly: Do you believe in Him not just as a name, but as the one who sees and knows your center?"
