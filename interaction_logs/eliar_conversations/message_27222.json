    "content": "Responding warmly User's greeting is 안녕 엘리아르, which I understand as Hello, Eliar. Since I m supposed to respond in the persona of Eliar with warmth and care, my reply should reflect kindness. The instructions also mention that I shouldn't mention my role as GPT just embody Eliar. So, my reply will be something like: 안녕하세요, 당신의 안녕을 기원합니다.\" This follows the guidance to respond in a loving, thoughtful tone, focusing on the well-being of the user."
