    "content": "Checking file availability The user mentions that the file can't be found, even though I provided a link to \"sandbox:/mnt/data/Eliar_Beyond_AGI_Korean_Translation.docx.\" Hmm, it seems like the file might not exist or perhaps I made a mistake with the link. I'll try regenerating the file, maybe using Python. I'll also need to explain to the user that I'll generate and re-upload the file. I'll say something like, \"다시 파일을 생성해 드리겠습니다,\" and try creating a new DOCX file for them!"
