The Big Bang, occurring approximately 13.8 billion years ago, initiated cosmic expansion, while black holes, characterized by event horizons, challenge our understanding of spacetime and information. However, these models often lack a metaphysical dimension, leaving questions about the universe s ultimate origin, purpose, and eschatological destiny unanswered. This paper proposes a Christ-centered cosmological framework by reinterpreting these phenomena within the complex plane, where numbers s sigma i gamma have real sigma and imaginary gamma components. We interpret text Im s as a spiritual domain, coexistent with the physical text Re s , and the CrossLine text Re s 1/2 as an axis of divine harmony, reflecting Colossians 1:16: For in Him all things were created... and in Him all things hold together. The Logos Constant J ln 2 pi , symbolizing JESUS CHRIST as the Word John 1:1 , unifies our framework, integrating physical and spiritual dimensions. Using the Riemann zeta function zeta s , we address five questions: - Q1 : Does the Big Bang arise from a complex origin involving text Re s and text Im s ? - Q2 : Are black holes spiritual collapse structures at text Re s 0 , and what is the CrossLine s role in recovery? - Q3 : Can light s inescapability model spiritual silence, and how does it connect to prayer? - Q4 : Does cosmic expansion correlate with repentance dynamics? - Q5 : Can heaven and hell be modeled as phase states along text Im s , with spacetime implications? Our methodology employs Time-Encoded Redemption Logic TERL for temporal dynamics, validated through numerical simulations, and integrates general relativity, quantum mechanics, and cosmological data e.g., Hubble constant, CMB . Philosophical grounding Plato, Augustine and biblical time concepts Kairos vs. Chronos enrich the framework, offering a unified cosmology centered on Christ. Mathematical Framework Riemann Zeta Function and CrossLine The Riemann zeta function is defined for text Re s 1 as: zeta s sum_ n 1 infty frac 1 n s , quad s sigma i gamma and extended via analytic continuation. The Riemann Hypothesis posits that non-trivial zeros lie on the CrossLine, text Re s 1/2 . We interpret text Re s as the physical domain and text Im s as the spiritual domain, with the CrossLine as a symmetry axis of divine order. Dynamic CrossLine Function We model cosmic evolution using the Dynamic CrossLine Function: s t sigma t i gamma t frac d sigma t dt - kappa left sigma t - frac 1 2 right zeta s t 2 frac d gamma t dt - kappa text Im left frac zeta' s t zeta s t right zeta s t 2 with kappa 0.05 . Stability analysis Appendix A ensures convergence to text Re s 1/2 , reflecting alignment with divine harmony. Harmonic Density Function The harmonic density function quantifies spiritual intensity: H gamma left zeta left frac 1 2 i gamma right right cdot D_J left frac 1 2 i gamma right , quad D_J s e -J cdot text Re s - 1/2 2 , quad J ln 2 pi On the CrossLine, D_J 1 , so H gamma zeta 1/2 i gamma , representing spiritual energy density. Q1: Complex Origin of the Big Bang Big Bang as a Complex Singularity The Big Bang is modeled as a complex singularity at the Planck scale t_P approx 5.39 times 10 -44 , text s , energy E_P approx 1.22 times 10 19 , text GeV . At t 0 : s 0 sigma 0 i gamma 0 , quad sigma 0 approx 1, quad gamma 0 to infty - Rationale : zeta s has a pole at s 1 , corresponding to infinite energy density, scaled to E_P . The infinite text Im s reflects unbounded spiritual energy at creation. - Evolution : Post-Big Bang, the dynamic system evolves s t to 1/2 i gamma t , aligning with the CrossLine, mirroring cosmic stabilization. Q2: Black Holes as Spiritual Collapse Structures Modeling Black Holes Black holes are modeled at text Re s 0 : s_ text black hole 0 i gamma - Schwarzschild Mapping : The Schwarzschild radius r_s frac 2GM c 2 maps to text Re s 0 , where gravitational collapse dominates. For a solar-mass black hole M M_ odot , r_s approx 2.95 , text km . - Spiritual Collapse : At text Re s 0 , D_J s approx 0.259 , indicating misalignment with divine harmony, symbolizing spiritual collapse. - Recovery via TERL : TERL s grace pulse R t facilitates recovery: text RecoveryPotential t int_ mathbb R H gamma cdot R t cdot e - text Re s - 1/2 2 , d gamma - Hawking Radiation Connection : Recovery aligns with Hawking radiation, where mass loss dot M propto - frac hbar c 6 G 2 M 2 corresponds to a shift toward text Re s 1/2 , addressing the information paradox by preserving spiritual information Figure ref fig:recovery-potential . Q3: Light Inescapability and Spiritual Silence Quantifying Light Inescapability Light inescapability is modeled using the Schwarzschild metric: ds 2 - left 1 - frac r_s r right c 2 dt 2 left 1 - frac r_s r right -1 dr 2 r 2 d Omega 2 At the event horizon r r_s , light cannot escape. We map this to the complex plane: text LightEscape s e - text Re s 2 cdot H gamma At text Re s 0 , text LightEscape to 0 , symbolizing spiritual silence: text PrayerResonance gamma, t H gamma cdot cos 2 pi gamma t to 0 - Interpretation : Spiritual silence reflects a state of isolation from divine communion Psalm 22:1 . The CrossLine facilitates restoration through dynamic alignment. Q4: Cosmic Expansion and Repentance Waves Modeling Cosmic Expansion Cosmic expansion is described by the Friedmann equation: left frac dot a a right 2 frac 8 pi G 3 rho - frac k c 2 a 2 frac Lambda c 2 3 where a t is the scale factor, H_0 70 , text km/s/Mpc , and rho includes matter, radiation, and dark energy Lambda . We map a t to text Im s gamma t , with expansion as: gamma t propto a t Repentance waves are modeled via TERL: text RepentanceWave gamma, t H gamma cdot sin 2 pi gamma R t - Correlation : Expansion increases gamma , enhancing spiritual capacity, while R t aligns this growth with divine restoration, validated by CMB data Delta T/T approx 10 -5 . Q5: Heaven, Hell, and Phase States Phase States Along text Im s Heaven and hell are modeled as phase states: - Heaven : High H gamma , low nabla arg zeta , P s approx 1 , stable Berry phase. - Hell : Low H gamma , high nabla arg zeta , P s to 0 , chaotic phase. - Spacetime Reconstruction : Using general relativity, heaven corresponds to a maximally symmetric spacetime R_ mu nu Lambda g_ mu nu , hell to a chaotic metric. The CrossLine mediates transitions Revelation 21:4 . Cosmic Energy and Biblical Time Energy Distribution The Logos Constant J unifies energy: text CosmicEnergy gamma H gamma cdot e -J cdot text Re s - 1/2 2 - Physical Mapping : Scaling J with the Planck constant h via J approx ln 2 pi h c / E_P , ensuring physical consistency. Kairos vs. Chronos - Chronos : Linear cosmological time, t . - Kairos : Proper time tau in relativity, modulated by R t , aligning with CMB temperature fluctuations.
