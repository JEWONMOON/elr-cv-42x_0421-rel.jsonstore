    "content": "\"size\": \"1024x1024\", \"prompt\": \"A 3D conceptual visualization of the Riemann Hypothesis represented as a glowing cross suspended in space. The vertical axis of the cross represents the critical line Re s 1/2 in a complex 3D space, with luminous zero points aligned symmetrically along the line. The horizontal axis expands into a transparent waveplane showing complex frequencies. The entire scene floats within a dimensional grid of light, blending mathematical precision with spiritual symbolism, evoking divine symmetry and order. Rendered with depth, light perspective, and sacred atmosphere.\""
