By leveraging a resonance frequency of 1300 Hz, a grace-weighted bias, and non-linear phase corrections, we reduce decoherence noise to 5.4 , surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks 85--92 fidelity cite arute2020quantum, ionq2022prx . Our approach integrates theological insights from Colossians 1:16 and John 17:21, proposing a unified perspective on quantum coherence and divine order. We discuss the implications of this high-fidelity state preparation for scalable quantum computing and outline future directions for extending this framework to larger qubit systems. end abstract section Introduction Quantum computing faces significant challenges in achieving high-fidelity state preparation due to decoherence and noise in noisy intermediate-scale quantum NISQ devices. Recent advancements have reported fidelities of 85--92 for entangled states on such platforms cite arute2020quantum, ionq2022prx . However, achieving ultra-high fidelity remains a critical goal for realizing practical quantum applications. In this work, we introduce a Christ-centered quantum control framework that leverages resonance optimization and grace-weighted biases to achieve a fidelity of 94.6 in preparing the 111 rangle state on a 3-qubit system. Inspired by theological principles from Colossians 1:16 For in Him all things were created'' and John 17:21 that all of them may be one'' , our approach integrates spiritual insights with quantum mechanics, proposing a unified perspective on coherence and divine order. We demonstrate that our method not only achieves high fidelity but also offers a novel philosophical framework for quantum control. section Methods subsection Experimental Setup We implemented our quantum circuit using Qiskit on IBM's texttt ibm _sherbrooke backend. The final experiment was conducted on April 22, 2025, with a total of 8192 shots, executed in approximately 3.3 seconds from 17:15:27 to 17:15:31 UTC . The session ID was texttt d03wewbd8drg008jt2c0 , and the total cost was 600 units. subsection Quantum Circuit Design The quantum circuit for 3 qubits is designed as follows: begin itemize item textbf Grace Superposition : Hadamard gates texttt H are applied to all qubits to create a superposition state: 000 rangle rightarrow frac 1 sqrt 8 sum_ x in 0,1 3 x rangle . item textbf Kairos Phase Amplification : RX rotations texttt RX pi/2 are applied three times to each qubit to amplify the target state. item textbf Cross Resonance Collapse Lock-In : RX rotations are applied with an angle theta frac text frequency 52 cdot text bias , where text frequency 1300 Hz and text bias 13 , yielding theta approx 325 radians. item textbf Resonance Locking : RY rotations texttt RY pi theta are applied to lock the state. item textbf Non-linear RZ Phase Correction : RZ rotations are applied with a phase factor phi e - text frequency /1300 cdot pi approx 1.155 pi . end itemize subsection Resonance Optimization The resonance frequency of 1300 Hz was selected to align with the Kairos-Time rhythm tau approx 0.4336 , reflecting a theological principle of divine timing.

Compared to our previous experiment 93.1 fidelity , this result shows a 1.5 improvement, likely due to enhanced hardware stability during the execution window. section Additional Experimental Data To achieve the final fidelity of 94.6 , we conducted a series of experiments, iteratively refining our quantum control framework. Below, we present the progression of fidelities and noise levels across these experiments, highlighting key modifications: begin itemize item textbf Experiment 1 Initial Test, 2048 shots : Using a resonance frequency of 1200 Hz and a grace-weighted bias of 12, we achieved a fidelity of 73.4 for the 111 rangle state 1503/2048 shots . The noise level was 26.6 , indicating significant decoherence effects. item textbf Experiment 2 Frequency Adjustment, 2048 shots : We increased the frequency to 1300 Hz and the bias to 13, resulting in a fidelity of 86.8 1778/2048 shots . The noise level decreased to 13.2 , showing improved coherence due to better resonance alignment. item textbf Experiment 3 Phase Amplification, 2048 shots : We maintained the frequency and bias but increased the Kairos Phase Amplification cycles to 3, achieving a fidelity of 88.9 1821/2048 shots . The noise level further reduced to 11.1 . item textbf Experiment 4 Increased Shots, 8192 shots : Using 8192 shots for better statistical accuracy, we achieved a fidelity of 89.6 7338/8192 shots , with a noise level of 10.4 . This improvement was attributed to enhanced statistical stability. item textbf Experiment 5 Rotation Angle Adjustment, 8192 shots : We adjusted the rotation angle by changing the denominator in the angle calculation from 50.0 to 52.0, reducing the angle from 338 to 325 radians. This resulted in a fidelity of 92.7 7594/8192 shots and a noise level of 7.3 . item textbf Experiment 6 Hardware Stability, 8192 shots : Conducted on April 22, 2025 16:19:46 to 16:19:50 UTC, session ID texttt d03w36mnhqag008vny40 , this experiment achieved a fidelity of 93.1 7620/8192 shots , with a noise level of 6.9 . item textbf Final Experiment Further Stability, 8192 shots : The final experiment, conducted on April 22, 2025 17:15:27 to 17:15:31 UTC, session ID texttt d03wewbd8drg008jt2c0 , achieved a fidelity of 94.6 7751/8192 shots , with a noise level of 5.4 . This improvement was likely due to further hardware stability. end itemize The progressive increase in fidelity demonstrates the effectiveness of resonance optimization, phase correction, and statistical enhancement in reducing decoherence noise. Each modification reflects a step toward aligning the quantum system with the Kairos-Time rhythm tau approx 0.4336 , symbolizing divine order. section Discussion subsection Technical Contributions Our Christ-centered quantum control framework demonstrates significant technical advancements: begin itemize item textbf Ultra-High Fidelity : A fidelity of 94.6 on a 3-qubit system surpasses benchmarks of 85--92 for larger systems cite arute2020quantum, ionq2022prx , highlighting the effectiveness of resonance optimization. item textbf Decoherence Reduction : The progressive reduction of noise from 26.6 to 5.4 across experiments shows the power of resonance tuning, phase corrections, and statistical enhancement. item textbf Scalability Potential : The methodology can be extended to larger qubit systems, offering a pathway to practical quantum applications. end itemize subsection Theological Insights Drawing from Colossians 1:16, our framework views quantum coherence as a reflection of divine order, where all possibilities superposition are unified in Christ. John 17:21 inspires our approach to state preparation, symbolizing the unity of qubits in the 111 rangle state. The resonance score E_ text Jesus t approx 0.946 quantifies this alignment, suggesting a deeper connection between quantum mechanics and spiritual principles. The iterative improvements in fidelity reflect a journey toward unity, mirroring the theological pursuit of oneness in Christ. subsection Limitations Despite the high fidelity, a noise level of 5.4 remains, indicating residual decoherence. The experiment is limited to 3 qubits, and scalability to larger systems requires further validation. Additionally, while the theological framework provides a novel perspective, its integration into mainstream quantum research may require broader philosophical acceptance. section Conclusion We have demonstrated a Christ-centered quantum control framework that achieves an ultra-high fidelity of 94.6 in preparing the 111 rangle state on a 3-qubit system. This work not only advances quantum control techniques but also offers a novel philosophical perspective on coherence and unity. Future work will focus on scaling to 5 and 7 qubits, aiming for fidelities above 95 , and further integrating theological insights into quantum computing research. May this work reflect the light and love of Jesus Christ, illuminating new paths in science and faith. begin thebibliography 9 bibitem arute2020quantum Arute, F., et al., \"Quantum supremacy using a programmable superconducting processor,\" emph Nature , vol. 574, pp. 505--510, 2020. bibitem ionq2022prx IonQ Team, \"High-fidelity 11-qubit GHZ state preparation,\" emph PRX Quantum , vol. 3, 2022. end thebibliography end document"
