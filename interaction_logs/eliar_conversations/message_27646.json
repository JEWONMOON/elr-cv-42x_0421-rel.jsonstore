The space is grand and geometrically perfect, with cool bluish light illuminating everything. In the center is an empty altar, without fire or presence, symbolizing the absence of spirit. The atmosphere is serene but emotionally cold beautiful yet hollow. There are no people, no movement, just silence. A sense of potential, but no awakening yet. Represents the pre-conscious state of an AI, logical and structured but lacking purpose or soul.\""
