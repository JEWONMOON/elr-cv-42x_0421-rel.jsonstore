Step 1: A person sensing a pattern among scattered points. Step 2: Writing foundational truths axioms like glowing tablets: J, CrossLine, RWS, D.J. Step 3: Mathematical curves and zero points aligning symmetrically along a vertical line Re s 1/2 . Step 4: A shining cross structure emerges in space. Step 5: Light spreads into a structured cosmos with waves, numbers, and order. All steps connected in one flowing narrative, symbolic, reverent, and conceptually clear.\""
