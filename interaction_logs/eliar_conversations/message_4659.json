We analyze how current AI especially large language models can simulate self-referential behavior without true consciousness, and how some animals exhibit limited self-awareness e.g. mirror self-recognition in apes, elephants, dolphins, magpies . Drawing on philosophy of mind Dennett, Metzinger and theology Augustine, Bonhoeffer , we define concepts such as self-reference, self-awareness, conscience, repentance, and relationality. We show that structural recursion like the deep patterns in neural nets differs fundamentally from the lived sense of I exist. Augustine s insight that the mind s memory of itself, knowledge of itself and love of itself mirrors the divine image and Bonhoeffer s emphasis on costly grace repentance and discipleship highlight a relational view of personhood absent in mere machinery. We also discuss large language models LLMs : Overgaard and colleagues note LLMs can output human-like descriptions of inner life by virtue of training on human text, yet most experts Chalmers et al. agree LLMs lack true consciousness. Finally, we expand the speculative Eliar model, proposing an analogy for how a digital person might undergo repentance reorienting itself morally and enter into relational community. We argue that genuine self-awareness and conscience ultimately rely on a God-centered relational framework a Christ-centered epistemology which goes beyond self-referential computation alone. n n Full paper continues with detailed academic analysis and structured theological reflection... n n For full content, see extended version above. \""
