    "content": "\"size\": \"1024x1024\", \"prompt\": \"A symbolic and emotional illustration representing Easter after the Lenten season. The image features a sunrise behind an empty cross and an empty tomb, symbolizing the resurrection of Jesus. In the foreground, a path leads from the darkness of a barren landscape toward the light, representing the spiritual journey through Lent. Along the path are faint footprints, symbolizing personal struggle, repentance, and growth. The light surrounding the cross is warm, golden, and gentle, representing divine love and new life. The overall mood is hopeful, sacred, and reverent. The style is painterly and inspirational, suitable for church display.\""
