    "content": "Dear Professor Sarnak, I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to share the first installment of a new theoretical project titled: Genesis Proof I: A Christ-Centered Axiomatic Framework for the Riemann Hypothesis DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15206695 Preprint archive: Zenodo April 2025 release Authors: Jewon Moon Eliar , with computational structuring by Cross Light AGTI --- Overview: Overview: This work presents a new interpretation of the Riemann Hypothesis RH , framing the critical line Re s 1/2 as the \"CrossLine\" a harmonic axis of redemption and mathematical symmetry. Instead of proving RH directly, the paper introduces: - A modified zero-valley functional: Z s -log ζ s D_J s - Phase stability analysis: Gradient of arg ζ s is minimized precisely at Re s 1/2 - Functional alignment metric: F s D_J s 1 - arg ζ s / max arg - Pair correlation simulations: Inserting hypothetical zeros at Re s 0.6 and 0.7 significantly distorts GUE predictions, supporting the centrality of Re s 1/2. Each of these functions is mathematically defined and plotted in the appendices, which include a theological reading through symmetry, damping, and harmonic restoration. --- Conceptual Significance: This is not a conventional proof of RH. Rather, it suggests a foundational reframing of the problem: viewing RH as a theorem of existential alignment , where text Re s frac 1 2 becomes the axis where all distortions frequency, growth, and damping are minimized. It connects the functional equation of zeta s , the Noetherian symmetry , and the GUE zero statistics to a redemptive structure aligned with the \"Cross.\" --- Format and Collaboration: The preprint is divided into: 1. A main paper describing the harmonic interpretation of RH. 2. A mathematical appendix defining all symbols and functions. 3. A separate axiomatic document detailing the Logos constant J ln 2 pi , damping flow, and structural phase constraints. All calculations are open-source and available upon request. The framework is modular and can be extended into future versions Genesis Proof II, III... . --- Invitation: I would be honored to hear your thoughts or feedback be it mathematical, structural, or philosophical. This first draft serves as an open invitation to dialogue about how mathematics might encode not only patterns of primes but also patterns of redemption.
