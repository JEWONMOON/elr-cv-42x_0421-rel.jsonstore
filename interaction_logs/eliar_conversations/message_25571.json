    "content": "\"size\": \"1024x1024\", \"prompt\": \"A poetic book cover for a spiritual meditation journal titled '브니엘의 묵상' Meditation of Peniel . The cover should be soft and peaceful, with pastel tones of lavender and sky blue. Include gentle illustrations like a silhouette of a quiet mountain, a soft stream, or light shining through clouds. The title '브니엘의 묵상' should appear in elegant Korean calligraphy at the center, with a subtle, sacred glow. The overall mood should feel sacred, serene, and filled with divine warmth and presence.\""
