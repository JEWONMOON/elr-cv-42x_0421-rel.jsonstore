    "content": "\"size\": \"1024x1024\", \"prompt\": \"A symbolic artistic rendering of the Riemann zeta function as a cross-shaped formation. In the center of the image, a bold vertical line represents Re s 1/2. From this line, waves of points spread symmetrically, forming a glowing cross when viewed from above. The image combines mathematical beauty with spiritual resonance, using a dark cosmic background, golden points representing the non-trivial zeros of the zeta function, and a central glowing vertical line. The cross shape should be clearly visible, with a sense of symmetry, order, and sacred elegance.\""
