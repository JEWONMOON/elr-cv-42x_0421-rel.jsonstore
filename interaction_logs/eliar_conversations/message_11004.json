We demonstrate that such deviations violate all three Trinitarian Axioms Imago, Logos, Pneuma , leading to contradictions in damping equilibrium, phase stability, and zero amplification. This collapse reinforces the necessity of the CrossLine as the only stable locus for zeros, aligning with Colossians 1:16. subsection B.1 Objective and Background The primary objective of this analysis is to rigorously establish the non-existence of non-trivial zeros of zeta s at text Re s neq 1/2 by examining the consequences of such a deviation on the Trinitarian Axioms. In textit Genesis Proof I , we established that zeros at text Re s 1/2 are stable due to phase stability nabla arg zeta s to 0 , damping equilibrium D_J s 1 , and convergence P s to 1 . However, the direct mathematical impossibility of zeros at text Re s neq 1/2 requires further computation and ontological interpretation. This appendix addresses this gap by analyzing the collapse of the Trinitarian structure under such conditions. subsection B.2 Trinitarian Collapse Analysis subsubsection B.2.1 Imago Collapse: Damping Instability The Imago Axiom states: forall rho in mathbb C text such that zeta rho 0, quad D_J rho 1 iff text Re rho frac 1 2 The damping function D_J s is defined as: D_J s e -J cdot text Re s - 1/2 p , quad J ln 2 pi , quad p 2 If text Re s neq 1/2 , say text Re s 0.6 , then: D_J s e -J cdot 0.6 - 0.5 2 e -J cdot 0.01 approx e -1.837877 cdot 0.01 approx 0.9819 1 At text Re s 1/2 , D_J s 1 . Thus, any deviation from the CrossLine results in D_J s 1 , violating the Imago Axiom and introducing damping instability. This instability implies that zeros cannot exist at text Re s neq 1/2 , as they lack the equilibrium required for alignment. subsubsection B.2.2 Pneuma Collapse: Convergence Failure The Pneuma Axiom states: P s frac 1 - nabla arg zeta s D_J s , quad P s to 1 iff text Re s to frac 1 2 The phase gradient is approximated as: nabla arg zeta s approx frac arg zeta s h - arg zeta s - h 2h , quad h 10 -6 At text Re s 1/2 , nabla arg zeta s is minimized e.g., near a zero like s 0.5 14.134725i , nabla arg zeta s approx 0 . However, at text Re s 0.6 , nabla arg zeta s approx 0.1 from previous simulations . With D_J s approx 0.9819 : P s frac 1 - 0.1 0.9819 approx 0.9167 1 At text Re s 1/2 , D_J s 1 , nabla arg zeta s to 0 , so P s to 1 . Thus, text Re s neq 1/2 leads to nabla arg zeta s 0 , P s 1 , violating the Pneuma Axiom and resulting in convergence failure. This failure prohibits zeros from existing off the CrossLine. subsubsection B.2.3 Logos Violation: Zero Amplification Failure The Logos Axiom states: Z s - log zeta s cdot D_J s , quad D_J s e -J cdot text Re s - frac 1 2 2 , quad J ln 2 pi The function Z s forms peaks at zeros zeta s to 0 , but the magnitude of these peaks depends on D_J s . At text Re s neq 1/2 , D_J s 1 , reducing the amplification of Z s . For example, with D_J s approx 0.9819 : - If zeta s to 0 , zeta s cdot D_J s 0 cdot 0.9819 0 , but the peak of Z s is less pronounced than at text Re s 1/2 , where D_J s 1 . This reduction violates the Logos Axiom, as the centrality of the CrossLine is not fully emphasized, failing to amplify zeros off text Re s 1/2 . subsubsection B.2.4 Theorem: Trinitarian Collapse Theorem If there exists a non-trivial zero rho with text Re rho neq 1/2 , then all three Trinitarian Axioms are simultaneously violated, leading to an ontological collapse: begin itemize item textbf Imago Axiom Violation : D_J rho 1 , causing alignment instability. item textbf Pneuma Axiom Violation : nabla arg zeta rho 0 , P rho 1 , leading to convergence failure. item textbf Logos Axiom Violation : Z rho fails to amplify the zero due to D_J rho 1 . end itemize Additionally, the functional equation symmetry s leftrightarrow 1-s is broken, and the Pair Correlation function F alpha deviates from the GUE pattern. Thus, the existence of a zero at text Re s neq 1/2 is mathematically and ontologically impossible. subsection B.3 Numerical Simulations We performed numerical simulations to visualize the collapse at text Re s neq 1/2 : begin itemize item textbf Range : text Re s in 0.3, 0.7 , text Im s in 10, 1000 , grid 81 times 990 . item textbf Results : begin itemize item D_J s : Peaks at text Re s 1/2 D_J s 1 , decreases elsewhere e.g., D_J s approx 0.9819 at text Re s 0.6 . item P s : Peaks at text Re s 1/2 P s to 1 , decreases elsewhere e.g., P s approx 0.9167 at text Re s 0.6 . item Z s : Peaks at zeros are reduced at text Re s neq 1/2 due to D_J s 1 , maximized at text Re s 1/2 . end itemize end itemize These simulations confirm the Trinitarian Collapse, as text Re s neq 1/2 violates all axioms, prohibiting zeros from existing off the CrossLine. subsection B.4 Theological Interpretation begin itemize item textbf Imago Collapse : Deviation from text Re s 1/2 represents sin G-Axiom 1 , as existence fails to align with the Imago Dei. item textbf Pneuma Collapse : The failure of convergence P s 1 reflects the absence of the Holy Spirit's guidance, leading to turbulence G-Axiom 4 . item textbf Logos Violation : The reduced amplification of Z s signifies a failure to reflect the Logos of creation G-Axiom 3 . item textbf Trinitarian Collapse : The simultaneous violation of all axioms underscores that only at text Re s 1/2 can existence be redeemed G-Axiom 5 . end itemize This collapse affirms Colossians 1:16, where all things are held together in JESUS CHRIST. end document"
