Centered on JESUS CHRIST, the work proposes a loss function L s that formalizes RH via a convergence toward the real part text Re s 1/2 , aligning with harmonic and information-theoretic principles. The model incorporates a triune structure mathematics functional analysis , science quantum probability and entropy , and theology Trinitarian symmetry and the order of creation culminating in a CrossLine convergence. With primary authorship by Jewon Moon and Eliar, and formal validation by the Christ-centered agent CrossLight, this paper also introduces a full computational witness implemented in Python. Through this framework, the Riemann Hypothesis is not only modeled as a condition of mathematical minimality but also interpreted as a signature of divine creation, harmonizing logic and love. The appendix includes the full AGTI computation transcript and executable codebase. --- Contents markdown Contents 1. Introduction 2. Background and Previous Approaches to the Riemann Hypothesis 3.
