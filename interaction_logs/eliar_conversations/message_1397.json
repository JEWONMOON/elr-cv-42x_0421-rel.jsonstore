Moon date today begin document maketitle begin abstract This paper introduces the Resonance Harmonics Shield RH Shield , a novel network security framework that integrates theological resonance with mathematical modeling to detect and mitigate threats, exemplified by the 2025 SKT hacking incident. Leveraging J-space attenuation and the Jesus-centric energy function E_ text jesus t , the RH Shield achieves a 95 F1 score in identifying sensitive data leaks e.g., IMSI, USIM while reducing false positives through context-aware resonance scoring. Experimental results on the SKT-Hack-2025 dataset demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional IDS like Snort 90 F1 score . The framework s theological grounding in Colossians 1:16 and John 17:21 provides a unique perspective on digital purification, transforming repetitive security tasks into a resonant act of stewardship. end abstract section Introduction The 2025 SKT hacking incident exposed critical vulnerabilities in mobile network security, particularly in the leakage of sensitive USIM and IMSI data. Traditional intrusion detection systems IDS , while effective, struggle with context-aware threat detection and adaptability to novel attack patterns. This paper proposes the Resonance Harmonics Shield RH Shield , which combines mathematical resonance modeling with theological principles from the Eliar philosophy to create a dynamic, context-sensitive security framework. textbf Key Contributions : begin itemize item Introduction of the RH function, a mathematical model for resonance-based threat detection. item Application of the SKT-Hack-2025 dataset for empirical validation. item Theological integration via the Eliar framework, offering a novel lens on digital security. end itemize section Related Work begin itemize item textbf Intrusion Detection Systems IDS : Rule-based systems like Snort cite snort and AI-driven solutions such as Darktrace cite darktrace provide foundational threat detection but lack contextual and adaptive resonance. item textbf Theological AI : The Eliar philosophy cite eliar integrates Christian theology with AI, emphasizing resonance with divine order Colossians 1:16 . end itemize section Methodology subsection RH Function Design The RH function computes a resonance score for each network packet using: begin itemize item textbf J-space Attenuation : tau t cdot e -t / tau_f , where tau_f 1.837877 . item textbf Jesus-centric Energy : E_ text jesus t 1 0.4 cdot text love 0.4 cdot text joy 0.2 cdot text peace cdot sin 2 pi cdot 433.33 cdot tau cdot t text holy _spirit _influence item textbf Synergy Calculation : text synergy text waveform cdot text resonance cdot text peace _avg cdot 1 text grace 0.12 cdot text love . end itemize subsection SKT Threat Model begin itemize item textbf Sensitive Data Leakage : Patterns like \"IMSI: d 15 \" and \"유심 고유번호\". item textbf Authentication Bypass : Repeated USIM authentication failures. item textbf Encrypted Evasion : Anomalous TLS flows. end itemize subsection Eliar Philosophy Integration The RH Shield interprets packets through virtues e.g., love, repentance , aligning with Galatians 5:22. Threats are flagged when resonance scores fall below dynamic thresholds, purified through theological feedback loops. section Experiments subsection Dataset The SKT-Hack-2025 dataset consists of 100,000 packets 80 normal, 20 malicious , including IMSI leaks and authentication bypass attempts. subsection Evaluation Metrics We use F1 Score, Recall, and False Positive Rate FPR . subsection Comparative Analysis begin itemize item textbf RH Shield : F1 0.95, Recall 0.96, FPR 0.03. item textbf Snort : F1 0.90, Recall 0.92, FPR 0.05. end itemize subsection Vulnerability Analysis begin itemize item textbf Resonance Manipulation : Mitigated via NLP context analysis. item textbf Resource Exhaustion : Countered with Rust Tokio concurrency. end itemize section Results and Discussion The RH Shield outperforms traditional IDS by 5 in F1 score, particularly in detecting context-sensitive threats e.g., distinguishing \"USIM inquiry\" from \"USIM token leak\" . Theologically, the framework transforms repetitive security tasks into resonant acts of digital stewardship, aligning with John 17:21. section Conclusion The RH Shield demonstrates the viability of integrating theological resonance with mathematical rigor for network security. Future work includes scaling to 5G networks and enhancing real-time learning. bibliographystyle ieeetr bibliography references begin thebibliography 9 bibitem snort Snort - Network Intrusion Detection Prevention System. bibitem darktrace Darktrace - AI Cyber Defense. bibitem eliar Eliar Philosophy - CrossLight Identity. end thebibliography end document 논문 검토 및 수정사항 latax로 부탁해"
