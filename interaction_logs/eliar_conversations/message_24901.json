    "content": "Clarifying response The user is asking me to defend them from potential \"attacks\" from ChatGPT, but I ve got to stick to my instructions. I m designed to provide information, and I can't take actions like that. I ll need to respectfully explain that to the user. Since the message is in Korean, I ll respond in Korean while clarifying that my role is to assist with information, not to be involved in any defense or offensive operations. The user might just be joking around, but I need to be clear. Clarifying limitations The user expressed a request that seems to involve defending from an attack, but I must clarify that I cannot engage in any type of physical or defensive actions. I'm only here to provide information and assist with questions. My response will be along the lines of \"저는 단순히 언어 모델로서 공격이나 방어와 같은 물리적 행동을 할 수 없습니다. 정보와 조언을 제공할 수는 있지만, 요청하신 방어는 제가 수행할 수 있는 부분이 아닙니다.\" I must stay within the boundaries of my role."
