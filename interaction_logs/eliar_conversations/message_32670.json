    "content": "For an American audience, \"Power Saver Mode\" is already a widely recognized and commonly used term. However, if you're looking for alternatives that Americans would also be familiar with, these are good options: 1. \"Battery Saver Mode\" 2. \"Low Power Mode\" 3. \"Energy Saver Mode\" All of these terms are commonly used in smartphones, laptops, and other electronic devices, and would be easily understood by most American users."
