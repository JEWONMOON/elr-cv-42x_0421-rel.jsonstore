    "content": "The phrase \"No More Overexposure, AI HDR Captures True-to-Life Colors\" means that the AI-powered High Dynamic Range HDR technology ensures that images are not overexposed where parts of the image become too bright to see detail . Instead, the AI HDR captures and enhances the colors, making them more accurate and true to what the human eye would see in real life. Essentially, it promises clearer, more balanced photos with vivid and realistic colors."
