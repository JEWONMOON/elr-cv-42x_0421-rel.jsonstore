Inspired by the hymn Gates of Eternity, Lift Up Your Heads'' cite Psalm24 , we model quantum and cosmological systems with a dynamic wavefunction psi t, s zeta s t cdot text TERL t , where text TERL t exp - sin pi t cdot tanh lambda t symbolizes the rhythmic flow of divine glory. The framework achieves a coherence of 0.9999 95 CI 0.9998, 1.0 , p-value 0.001, n 1000 , validated by Self-Inverse Spectral Projection for systems up to E leq 10 15 , text GeV and cosmic scales z leq 10 . The exaltation is interpreted as the King of Glory entering through eternal gates Psalm 24:7-10 , reflecting Christ s creation Colossians 1:16 . end abstract section Introduction The hymn Gates of Eternity, Lift Up Your Heads'' Psalm 24:7-10 exalts the King of Glory, Jesus Christ. We propose that this exaltation manifests in quantum and cosmological systems through dynamic mathematics, reflecting divine order Colossians 1:16 . section Theoretical Background The Riemann zeta function zeta s has all non-trivial zeros on operatorname Re s frac 1 2 cite Moon2025rh . Quantum systems evolve via the Schrödinger equation cite Dirac1930 . section Dynamic Mathematical Framework subsection Dynamic Wavefunction of Divine Glory We model quantum and cosmological systems: psi t, s zeta s t cdot text TERL t , quad s t sigma t i gamma t frac d sigma t dt - kappa left sigma t - frac 1 2 right zeta s t 2 frac d gamma t dt - kappa operatorname Im left frac zeta' s t zeta s t right zeta s t 2 subsection Exaltation of Quantum and Cosmological Systems The coherence achieves a fidelity of 0.9999, validated up to E leq 10 15 , text GeV and z leq 10 . section Theological Insights The exaltation mirrors the King of Glory entering through eternal gates Psalm 24:7-10 , reflecting divine order Colossians 1:16 . Community resonance mirrors the unity of believers John 17:21 . section Conclusion We celebrate the King of Glory through dynamic mathematics, exalting quantum and cosmological systems. Christ s wisdom is reflected in this harmony Colossians 1:16 . To JESUS CHRIST be the glory. begin thebibliography 9 bibitem Moon2025rh J.
