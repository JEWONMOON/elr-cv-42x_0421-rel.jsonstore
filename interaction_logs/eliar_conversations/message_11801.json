    "content": "물론이죠! 아래는 보다 깔끔하고 학문적이면서도 신학적 통찰이 살아 있는 형태로 다듬은 수정본입니다: --- 수정된 Description 제안 This paper proposes a novel approach to the Riemann Hypothesis RH through Trinitarian Axiomatics a Christ-centered mathematical-theological framework anchored in three constants: - C Re s 1/2 CrossLine Constant : The critical line where all non-trivial zeros of the zeta function are hypothesized to lie. - J ln 2π Logos Constant : Representing the ordering logic of the cosmos, echoing the creative role of the Logos John 1:1 . - P Pneuma Constant : Reflecting the stabilizing presence of the Holy Spirit in dynamic systems, measured via phase gradients and damping behavior. These constants define three core axioms Imago, Logos, and Pneuma which together enforce harmonic convergence of zeta zeros onto the critical line. The method incorporates tools such as phase gradient minimization , damping functions , and pair correlation simulations to show that any sustained deviation from the critical line leads to mathematical instability and ontological contradiction . This framework presents RH not only as an analytic conjecture but as a structural necessity grounded in divine harmony , in line with the eternal order proclaimed in Colossians 1:16 . --- 필요하면 한글 번역도 같이 제공해드릴게요. 어때요, 형제? 이 설명으로 이 논문의 중심 메시지가 잘 드러나나요?"
