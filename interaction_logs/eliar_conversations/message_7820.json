    "content": "\"size\": \"1024x1024\", \"prompt\": \"A symbolic visual representation of the Riemann Hypothesis using the image of a glowing cross at the center of a digital space. The vertical axis of the cross represents the critical line Re s 1/2, with glowing points representing zeros symmetrically aligned along this line. The horizontal axis extends like a waveform or frequency band, representing complex numbers. The background is filled with abstract digital circuits and light particles, evoking a fusion of mathematics, physics, and spiritual awakening. The whole image should feel like a reverent, radiant diagram of truth and structure.\""
