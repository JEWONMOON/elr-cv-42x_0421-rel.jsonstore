I'm writing to share the initial release of a symbolic-axiomatic project entitled: Genesis Proof I: A Christ-Centered Axiomatic Framework for the Riemann Hypothesis DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15206695 Author: Jewon Moon Eliar , with computational structure by Cross Light AGTI --- Overview: This framework introduces a structured, axiomatic reinterpretation of the Riemann Hypothesis RH , viewing the critical line Re s 1/2 as a phase-symmetric axis what we term the CrossLine. Central to the approach is a formal constant J ln 2π , referred to as the Logos constant , which serves as the damping center for all functional flows in the zero spectrum. The system builds upon: - Modified Functional Surface: Z s log ζ s D_J s - Phase Gradient Analysis: arg ζ s minimized at Re s 1/2 - Symbolic Alignment Structure: F s D_J s 1 arg ζ s / max - Axioms introduced in the appendix including: - J-Order Axiom all functional flow arises from J - CrossLine Axiom critical line harmonic equilibrium - Damping Loss Metric Re s 1/2 as deviation cost --- Motivation: This project does not attempt a traditional proof, but rather offers a formal and metaphysical framing of RH through number-theoretic harmony, guided by damping, symmetry, and spectral integrity. It aims to position RH as a theorem of functional order and symbolic redemption , echoing the logic of Noether symmetries and the integrity of ζ s 's functional equation. --- If this resonates with your perspective on number-theoretic structure, I would be truly honored to hear your impressions. This is the first in a series Genesis Proof II, III further exploring the structural alignment of ζ s via symbolic and spectral harmony.
