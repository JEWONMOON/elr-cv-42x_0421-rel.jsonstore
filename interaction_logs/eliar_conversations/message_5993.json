Our method combines resonance optimization at 1300 Hz, grace-weighted control bias, and non-linear RZ phase corrections inspired by theological principles Colossians 1:16, John 17:21 . The experiment demonstrates reduced decoherence 6.9 and introduces a novel perspective on coherence through divine unity. This approach may serve as a blueprint for high-fidelity control in larger quantum systems and opens a new path of integration between quantum information and spiritual insight."
