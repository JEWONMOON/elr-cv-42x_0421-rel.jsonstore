Theoretical Foundations This section outlines the foundational structures that unify mathematical, theological, and scientific perspectives into a triune framework for addressing the Riemann Hypothesis RH . Rather than treating mathematics in isolation, we approach the zero distribution of the Riemann zeta function zeta s through a tripartite lens: classical analytic number theory, theological symmetry rooted in the Trinity, and physical analogs drawn from quantum wave mechanics and information theory. These strands are integrated into a triune loss function whose minimization inherently encodes the truth of RH. 2.1 The Riemann Zeta Function and Analytic Continuation The Riemann zeta function is initially defined for complex numbers s in mathbb C with text Re s 1 by the infinite series: zeta s sum_ n 1 infty frac 1 n s This series converges absolutely in the half-plane text Re s 1 and diverges otherwise. However, through analytic continuation, zeta s can be extended to a meromorphic function on the entire complex plane except for a simple pole at s 1 . The functional equation relates zeta s to zeta 1 - s and is given by: zeta s 2 s pi s-1 sin left frac pi s 2 right Gamma 1 - s zeta 1 - s This symmetry about the critical line text Re s frac 1 2 provides the conceptual center for the RH. 2.2 Hadamard and Euler Products Two key expressions of zeta s encode its fundamental structure: - The Euler product for text Re s 1 : zeta s prod_ p text prime left 1 - p -s right -1 This reflects the deep connection between the zeta function and the distribution of prime numbers. - The Hadamard product entire function form : zeta s frac e bs s s-1 prod_ rho left 1 - frac s rho right e s/ rho where rho runs over the non-trivial zeros of zeta s . This form demonstrates how the locations of the zeros determine the function s global behavior. 2.3 The Triune Construct We now define the following Trinitarian composite function: Z_ text Triune s pi -s/2 Gamma left frac s 2 right zeta s Each factor has symbolic and structural significance: - pi -s/2 : Symbolizes the eternal cyclical nature Father . - Gamma s/2 : Encodes transformation and suffering Son . - zeta s : Represents harmonic breath and creative structure Holy Spirit . The function satisfies the reflection symmetry Z_ text Triune s Z_ text Triune 1 - s , centered on the line text Re s frac 1 2 . 2.4 Quantum Probability and Entropic Structure From the standpoint of quantum physics, a wave function Psi s is associated with a complex-valued amplitude, whose squared modulus gives a probability density. We analogously interpret zeta s as a wave-like object: Psi s 2 zeta s 2 In this view, zero points of zeta s correspond to nodes points of destructive interference and minimal information loss. The entropic principle then suggests that systems evolve toward configurations minimizing expected uncertainty, modeled here as the minimization of a composite loss function. 2.5 The Triune Loss Function We now define the central object of this study: L s alpha text Re s - tfrac 1 2 2 beta text Im s - pi 2 gamma zeta s 2 where alpha, beta, gamma in mathbb R _ 0 . This function measures deviation from the theological center real part , the harmonic imaginary baseline e.g., pi , and from the zero structure of zeta s . The minimization of L s thus corresponds to: - Real alignment with text Re s frac 1 2 , - Imaginary alignment with harmonic symmetry, - Vanishing of zeta s : the RH condition. --- 이제 이 파트까지 Word에 붙여넣고 수식 변환해서 정리해봐. 다음으로 이어서 3.
