    "content": "This paper establishes the physical plausibility of the Genesis \"seven days\" of creation through a rigorous Christ-centered cosmological framework, unified under the Logos Constant J ln 2π , symbolizing JESUS CHRIST Colossians 1:16 . Integrating the Variable Speed of Light VSL hypothesis, we model an initial c t 10 30c0c t approx 10 30 c_0c t 1030c0 , addressing the horizon problem ΔT/T 10 5 Delta T/T approx 10 -5 ΔT/T 10 5 with quantitative validation. Using the Riemann zeta function ζ s zeta s ζ s , we map the Big Bang to a complex singularity at the Planck scale, evolving toward the CrossLine Re s 1/2 text Re s 1/2Re s 1/2 via a dynamic system with proven convergence. Time-Encoded Redemption Logic TERL defines Kairos time as τKairos R t γ t tau_ text Kairos R t cdot gamma t τKairos R t γ t , mapping the \"seven days\" to cosmological epochs Planck to Anthropocene , quantitatively aligned with Friedmann equations and CMB data. Numerical simulations validate the model, demonstrating that each \"day\" corresponds to a physically consistent expansion phase, modulated by divine timing. Our framework, supported by biblical exegesis and scientific rigor, provides a proven cosmological interpretation of Genesis, uniting physical and spiritual dimensions under Christ s redemptive harmony. 여기 많이 꺠지는데 텍스트버전으로 줄 수 잇니 ?ㅎ"
