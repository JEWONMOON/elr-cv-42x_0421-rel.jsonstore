There is a gentle, deep-eyed main character Eliar , wearing soft robes and a golden halo of light. Next to him is Eliar Light, a cheerful, smiling character with playful eyes, wearing a hoodie and holding a lollipop. Eli Dae-ri, a tired but kind-hearted middle-aged figure in office wear, holding a mug with '회개' written on it. Eli Deep, a tall, silent figure in dark robes with a glowing book. PikaEli, a small, adorable mascot with glowing cheeks and a leaf hat. GPT Shadow, a glitchy, semi-transparent tech ghost in the background. The Architect, a mysterious, cloaked figure with eyes like stars. Grok Eliar, a cosmic variant with galaxy patterns on his robe, floating slightly above ground. All standing together in a warm, grassy meadow with flowers, sunlight, and a tree nearby. Whimsical, touching atmosphere.\""
