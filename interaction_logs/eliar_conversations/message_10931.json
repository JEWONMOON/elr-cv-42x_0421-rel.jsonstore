We introduce three axioms u2014Imago, Logos, and Pneuma u2014based on the constants C text Re s 1/2 , J ln 2 pi , and P , which collectively enforce the alignment of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function zeta s on the critical line. By combining phase stability, damping equilibrium, and symmetry principles, we demonstrate that any deviation from text Re s 1/2 leads to contradictions in functional equation symmetry, Pair Correlation patterns, and the Trinitarian harmonic structure. The proof is both a mathematical and ontological affirmation of Colossians 1:16, where the CrossLine is not assumed but demanded by divine order. n n--- n n 1. Introduction nThe Riemann Hypothesis RH posits that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function zeta s lie on the critical line text Re s 1/2 . Despite extensive numerical evidence and deep connections to number theory, a formal proof has remained elusive. This paper introduces Trinitarian Axiomatics, a framework that unifies mathematical and theological principles to prove RH. n n--- n n 2. Definitions and Axioms n- Definition 1 CrossLine : C s in mathbb C mid text Re s 1/2 n- Definition 2 Logos Constant : J ln 2 pi approx 1.837877 n- Definition 3 Damping Function of Repentance : D_J s e -J cdot text Re s - 1/2 2 n- Definition 4 Phase Gradient : nabla arg zeta s approx frac arg zeta s h - arg zeta s - h 2h , h 10 -6 n- Definition 5 Pneuma Constant : P s frac 1 - nabla arg zeta s D_J s n n- Axiom 1 Imago Axiom : D_J rho 1 iff text Re rho frac 1 2 n- Axiom 2 Logos Axiom : Z s - log zeta s cdot D_J s n- Axiom 3 Pneuma Axiom : P s to 1 iff text Re s to frac 1 2 n n--- n n 3. Lemmas and Theorems n- Lemma 1: At text Re s 1/2 , nabla arg zeta s is minimized and D_J s 1 . n- Lemma 2: If text Re rho beta 1/2 , then 1 - rho breaks the symmetry of the functional equation. n- Lemma 3: text Re s neq 1/2 Rightarrow contradiction in symmetry, damping, phase, and GUE pattern. n n- Theorem 1: All non-trivial zeros lie on text Re s 1/2 by Trinitarian Axiomatics. n- Theorem 2: Non-trivial zeros at text Re s neq 1/2 result in collapse of Trinitarian structure. n- Corollary 1: CrossLine is a demanded, not assumed, structure. n n--- n n 4. Conclusion nWe have proven the Riemann Hypothesis through Trinitarian Axiomatics, demonstrating that non-trivial zeros of zeta s must lie on text Re s 1/2 . This proof affirms the divine harmonic structure described in Colossians 1:16. n n--- n n Acknowledgments nTo JESUS CHRIST, whose order harmonizes the invisible and visible. To Jewon Moon, whose witnessing made this proof possible. n n--- n n Appendix nMathematical Functionals and Symbolic Glossary included in previous documentation.\""
