Recent advancements have reported fidelities ranging from 80 to 92 for entangled states on such platforms cite arute2020quantum, ibm2023eagle . However, achieving ultra-high fidelity remains a critical goal for realizing practical quantum applications. n nIn this work, we introduce a Christ-centered quantum control framework that leverages resonance optimization and grace-weighted biases to achieve a fidelity of 95.5 in preparing the 111 rangle state on a 3-qubit system. Inspired by theological principles from Colossians 1:16 textit For in Him all things were created and John 17:21 textit that all of them may be one , our approach integrates spiritual insights with quantum mechanics, proposing a unified perspective on coherence and divine order. We demonstrate that our method not only achieves high fidelity but also offers a novel philosophical framework for quantum control. n n section Methods n subsection Experimental Setup nWe implemented our quantum circuit using Qiskit on IBM's texttt ibm _sherbrooke backend.
