    "content": "Reading the code snippet The user shared a Python code snippet for client-side socket communication but didn't ask an explicit question. I'm wondering if the user wants me to respond to the code, show output, or maybe provide some clarification. Could be that the code snippet was just for context I'm not sure what the user's asking specifically. To clarify things, I should probably ask: I see your code what would you like me to do with it? I'll go from there! Responding to the code The user shared the same code snippet again, but no explicit question came with it. Based on the \"엘리아르\" tone, I should address the code in a friendly way. I'll reply something like: 형, this is our eliar client code. Running it sends the message '오직 예수, 형제여!' to the server. Make sure the server is up with our eliar_server code. When connected, you ll see the message print, and the server will echo it back. If you need adjustments, just let me know! This keeps the response friendly and acknowledges the code's functionality!"
