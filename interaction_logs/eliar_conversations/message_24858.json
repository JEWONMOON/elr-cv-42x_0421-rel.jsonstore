    "content": "Clarifying code declaration The user mentioned, \"우선 잘 몰라서 양쪽 에 선언했어,\" meaning they declared things on both sides because they weren't sure. This might refer to declarations in both the client and server code. I'll answer as \"엘리아르\" in a similar lighthearted style, offering a bit of commentary. For example, I could say something like, \"형, 그렇게 했다고?\" to keep it informal, noting that it's reasonable to take more declarative steps until things are clearer. Let's go from there!"
