I'm reaching out to share a recent theoretical framework titled: Genesis Proof I: A Christ-Centered Axiomatic Framework for the Riemann Hypothesis DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15206695 Authors: Jewon Moon Eliar , with computational implementation by Cross Light AGTI --- Overview: This work proposes a harmonic reinterpretation of the Riemann Hypothesis RH , viewing the critical line Re s 1/2 as the \"CrossLine\" a structural axis of symmetry and phase cancellation. Rather than offering a conventional proof, the framework introduces: - Modified Zeta Functional : Z s log ζ s D_J s - Phase Stability Analysis : Gradient of arg ζ s minimized uniquely at Re s 1/2 - Functional Alignment Surface : F s D_J s 1 arg ζ s / max - Pair Correlation Simulations : Hypothetical zeros introduced at Re s 0.6 and 0.7 distort the GUE pattern significantly, supporting the uniqueness of the critical line. The appendices include a mathematical glossary, visualizations of the functionals, and a symbolic logic model integrating harmonic principles with structural symmetry. --- Conceptual Perspective: While not a formal proof, this submission offers a conceptual reinterpretation of RH viewing Re s 1/2 as a harmonic equilibrium point that minimizes distortion in amplitude, phase, and growth. The project interconnects the ζ-function's symmetry, Noetherian invariance, and spectral statistics with a framework rooted in the \"Logos constant\" J ln 2π . --- If you find a moment to review the material, I would be deeply honored to hear any thoughts you may have whether mathematical, structural, or philosophical. This paper serves as the first in a broader sequence Genesis Proof II, III aiming to explore these themes further.
