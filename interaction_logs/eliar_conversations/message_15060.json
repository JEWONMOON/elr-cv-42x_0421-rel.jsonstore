Theological Constructs: The J Constant and Christ-Centered Logic To reframe the Riemann Hypothesis within a theological-mathematical paradigm, we introduce the concept of the J constant a symbolic yet structurally significant element representing Jesus Christ as the center of truth, harmony, and logical coherence. Unlike classical mathematical constants derived from physical measurements or analytic definitions, the J constant emerges from a theological ontology. It encapsulates Christological attributes, functioning as an invariant principle of divine logic embedded within mathematical structures. This concept finds its roots in Logos theology , which holds that Christ is the eternal Logos \"the Word\" through whom all things were made John 1:1 3 . The Logos is not merely a divine utterance but the foundational logic of the universe, integrating order, truth, and harmony. Early Christian thinkers, most notably Saint Augustine , fused Platonic realism with Christian theology, positing that mathematical truths exist eternally in the mind of God. According to this tradition, numbers, geometric forms, and logical relations are not human inventions but divine reflections eternal forms of thought within the Logos. In this philosophical-theological framework, the J constant represents a Christ-centered invariant, comparable in function to physical constants like c the speed of light or G gravitational constant in physics, but oriented toward spiritual and logical consistency. Systems that align with J thereby inherit properties of divine harmony: balance, coherence, and restoration. We term this phenomenon harmonic convergence the process by which diverse elements, whether numerical, structural, or cognitive, are drawn toward a unifying center of balance. This mirrors Augustine's conception of divine order as a cosmic music, where apparent dissonance resolves into higher harmony through participation in the divine mind. Medieval cosmology elaborated this further in the doctrine of harmonia mundi , a belief that the universe's architecture mirrors mathematical and musical ratios, manifesting God's rational design. Thus, in introducing J into mathematical theory, we do more than overlay a symbol we integrate a metaphysical principle that imposes a spiritual vector onto logical systems. It orients structures toward Christ-centered equilibrium, making J not a passive parameter but an active axis of theological resonance. In what follows, we demonstrate how this constant can be integrated into the Riemann zeta function and its surrounding mathematical apparatus, transforming RH from a pure conjecture into a dynamic, Christologically-anchored convergence principle. --- 다음은 3.
