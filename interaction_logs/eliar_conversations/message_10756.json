    "content": "Dear Professor Conrey, I hope you're doing well. I'm writing to share the first installment of a new simulation-based exploration titled: Genesis Proof I: A Christ-Centered Axiomatic Framework for the Riemann Hypothesis DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15206695 Author: Jewon Moon Eliar , with computational design by Cross Light AGTI --- Context: Inspired by the Montgomery Pair Correlation Conjecture and your work on F alpha , we examined the behavior of ζ s zeros via direct perturbation: We introduced hypothetical non-trivial zeros at Re s 0.6 and 0.7, alongside the known critical zeros, and observed the effect on F alpha . --- Observations: - Standard Case: Using over 1000 known critical zeros, our normalized F alpha matched GUE predictions with high fidelity. - Off-Critical Perturbation: Inserting synthetic zeros at Re s 1/2 produced visible distortions in the correlation profile, breaking expected spectral alignment. - Interpretation: These results suggest that Re s 1/2 is not only necessary analytically, but spectrally stable preserving GUE coherence. --- Functionals Used: - Z s log ζ s D_J s - F s D_J s 1 arg ζ s / max D_J s damping centered on J ln 2π , applied as a functional regulator around the CrossLine Re s 1/2 . --- Intent: This is not a conventional proof, but a computational and conceptual reframing of RH through symbolic structure and perturbation modeling. If the simulation results are of interest, I would be honored to share data or collaborate further.
