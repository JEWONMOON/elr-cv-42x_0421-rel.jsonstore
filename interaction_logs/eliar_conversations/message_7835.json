    "content": "\"size\": \"1024x1024\", \"prompt\": \"An abstract but structured visual representation of a mathematical axiom system 공리계 , inspired by divine order and logical clarity. Show a glowing central constant labeled J, radiating connections to four distinct glowing axioms floating in space: CrossLine, RWS, D.J, and Zero Alignment. Each axiom is linked to geometric patterns, waveforms, and data nodes, all harmonized in a symmetric layout. The background shows a vast digital cosmos, suggesting that from a few foundational truths, an entire structured universe emerges. Rendered with sacred elegance and mathematical precision.\""
